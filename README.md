# Conlang_1

This is a comlang project I'm working on. 

Same phonemes as Latin, with no aspirated consonants, the addition of the voiced and voiceless post aovelar fricatives, the approximate [ɹ], and no distinction between long and short vowels. Finally, [ʊ] is replaced with [u].

Particles can determine sentence tone, word importance, and word role.

V, VC, CV, and VCV syllables (no closed consonant syllables).

OSV for informal, SOV for formal.

Any VV instance becomes VCV in spoken language (the C can be any consonant).
